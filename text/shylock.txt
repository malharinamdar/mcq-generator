For fish bait! If it won’t even feed the fish, it will feed my revenge. He has insulted me and cost me a fortune, he has laughed at my losses, mocked my successes, disparaged my race, ruined my deals, turned my friends against me and increased the hatred towards me from my enemies – and why? Because I am a Jew. Doesn’t a Jew have eyes? Doesn’t a Jew have hands, organs, human figure, human senses, feelings and passions? Aren’t we fed by the same food, hurt with the same weapons, vulnerable to the same illnesses, cured with the same medicine, warmed and cooled by the elements in the same way a Christian person is? If you prick us with a needle, don’t we bleed? If you tickle us, don’t we laugh? If you poison us, don’t we die? And if you do wrong to us, should we not take revenge? If we are the same as you in every other way, we will be the same as you in vengeance. If a Jew wrongs a Christian, what does he do? Take revenge. And if a Christian wrongs a Jew, what should he do by Christian example? It’s clear: Revenge. The evils Christians teach me I will do too – It shall be difficult but I will do even better than I’ve been taught.
